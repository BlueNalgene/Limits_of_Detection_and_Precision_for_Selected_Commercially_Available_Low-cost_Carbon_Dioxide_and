> Optical and chemiresistive metal-oxide sensors for carbon dioxide and methane are compared
> Sensors are analyzed for precision, accuracy, and sensitivity.
> Noise and response time data are reported for the tested sensors.
> Trade-offs for the selection of an appropriate sensor of those studied in this paper are discussed.
