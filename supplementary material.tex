For this study, the application includes, but is not limited to, environmental monitoring of local gas concentration and detection of leaks around industrial locations.	%	For such applications, the collection of multiple samples at several locations in a given area (possibility including places without power availability) is critical to obtain reliable results.	%	Thus, with only two exceptions, sensors selected were all commercially available in large volumes (at least 1000 units) at low-cost (defined here as less than \$100 per unit in bulk)	%    The sensors were further selected based on the reported sensitivity at environmental concentrations of \ce{CO2} (around 400 ppm~\cite{blasing_recent_2016,dlugokencky_trends_2016}) and \ce{CH4} ( under 2 ppm~\cite{turner_large_2016,bamberger_spatial_2014,dlugokencky_trends_2016-1}), and at concentrations of several thousand ppm, which simulate a potential leak.    %	In the selection process, the cost, limit of detection, precision, accuracy, reliability, and power consumption are all important parameters, many of which are not reported the manufacture or cannot be directly compared to other similar sensors.   	%% PARA	   \section*{Sensing Technology}  Lower cost optical sensors typically utilize nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensing.    %  This method utilizes a broad spectrum light source which is restricted by a narrow band pass filter across the absorbance maximum before reaching the detector.  %  Since these sensors utilize the Beer-Lambert law to relate absorption to concentration, the calibration is only dependent on the geometry of the sensor and physical properties of the gas~\cite{bacsik_ftir_2004}.  %  In general, NDIR detection is utilized for \ce{CO2} due to its relatively large molar absorption coefficient, allowing for short path lengths to be used in devices.    %  For \ce{CH4}, NDIR detection is limited due to its lower absorption coefficient and overlapping symmetric C-H stretches.  %  The overlapping stretches makes \ce{CH4} difficult to distinguish from other common aliphatic gases such as ethane and propane~\cite{coblentz_society_inc._evaluated_????}.  %  The selected lower cost chemiresistive sensors typicality detect \ce{CH4}  using a thin oxide film~\cite{neri_first_2015} and work by measuring resistance changes due to differences in the electron transport through the metal oxide film, in the presence of oxygen and target gases~\cite{albert_cross-reactive_2000}.  %  The resistance change is typically non-linear with the analyte concentration.  %  The chemiresistive sensors are known to respond to a range of hydrocarbon gases~\cite{sekhar_development_2016}, which should be considered when integrating these sensors into a sensor platform.  %% PARA    	\section*{Selected Sensors}   Table~\ref{tab:CO2property} lists the selected \ce{CO2} sensors with important properties obtained from the manufacturer.   %   Table~\ref{tab:CH4property} lists the \ce{CH4} or hydrocarbon sensors and respective properties.  The K-30, COZIR, Dynament, and Telaire sensors are all NDIR sensors.   %   These sensors were chosen as low-cost, lightweight sensors with satisfactory detection parameters of \ce{CO2}.   %   Dynament also provides a dual gas NDIR sensor (MSH-DP/HC/CO2/) designed to measure both \ce{CO2} and \ce{CH4} concentrations.   %   This ability was attractive given low-cost and portability requirements.   %   The \ce{CO2} and \ce{CH4} Gascard sensors sold by GHG Analytical were an order of magnitude more expensive than the other chosen NDIR sensors, which have a cost between that of the lowest cost sensors on our list and that of the bench-top analyzers.   %   Their specifications combined with the included pressure and temperatures compensation make them attractive enough to make up for the expense.   %   In addition to the Gascard sensor, the Dynament hydrocarbon sensors (MSH-P/HC and MSH-DP/HC/CO2/) were chosen as inexpensive candidates for \ce{CH4} detection.   %   Chemoresistive sensors include the MQ-4 from Hanwei Electronics and TGS-2600, TGS-2610, and TGS-2611 manufactured by Figaro Engineering Inc. sensors.   %   The TGS sensors are used in commercial \ce{CH4} and air quality detectors.   %   There are several different MQ versions optimized for hydrocarbon sensing.   %   The MQ-4 sensor was chosen as this variant was specifically tuned for \ce{CH4}.   %% PARA	\begin{table*}[!th]		\caption{Manufacturer listed properties of evaluated \ce{CO2} sensors}		\label{tab:CO2property}		\small		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%			\begin{tabular}{ r | c c c c c }				Sensor               & Supplier         & Type & Sampling Method   & Cal.
