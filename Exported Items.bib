  abstract = {Abstract We present results on research and development of catalytic sensors fabricated by planar technology on anodic alumina membranes. A method to detect methane was developed which prevents humidity from affecting the sensor performance and, at the same time, reduces energy consumption. The method, based on step heating the sensor during measurements, enables the power consumption of the sensor to decrease from 35mW typical of the conventional measurement method to 1.2mW. As a result, a wireless sensor node equipped with a planar sensor and powered by three AA batteries could operate for about one year.},

  abstract = {Abstract In order to expand current atmospheric methane monitoring capabilities, we investigated the performance of an off-the-shelf, low-cost, metal oxide based methane (CH4) gas sensor. A sensor assembly was designed that powered the gas sensor and its resistive heater, provided ancillary temperature (T) and relative humidity (rH) measurements, and controlled sensor read-out and data storage. After calibrating the gas sensor with respect to methane concentration ([CH4]), T, and rH, we were able to estimate the [CH4] of lab air over a period of 31days for a large range of T and rH conditions with a systematic error of -1.0ppm and a variable error within $\pm$1.7ppm. The sensor showed no significant drift in [CH4] estimate. We show that sensor accuracy can likely be improved by optimizing the voltage regulator that powers the gas sensor's heater, and by measuring and compensating for the difference in partial oxygen pressure of the air that was sampled during calibration and validation experiments. Such improvements are expected to allow the use of the sensor assembly for fence-line methane monitoring, for example near fossil fuel extraction sites. In its current form, the sensor assembly is suitable for detecting fugitive methane from leak-prone equipment.},

  abstract = {Abstract The capabilities of a chemiresistive microsensor array for detecting and identifying trace target analytes were examined under a simulated Martian atmosphere. The simulated environment included low oxygen content (0.15\%) balanced by carbon dioxide, low pressure (7.5hPa) and temperature (199.1K), and trace levels of up to three target molecules presented simultaneously. The target molecules were selected from four possible analytes (methane, hydrogen, ethane and sulfur dioxide), presented to the sensor array at multiple concentrations of 200nmol/mol or less. Signals from four elements of a 16-element microsensor array were employed in the data analyses described. Each element used a different sensing film and was operated with a dynamic temperature program tuned to the background environment. The rich data streams collected from the microsensor array as it was exposed to the complex mixtures and carbon dioxide-based background were analyzed using two approaches: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Analysis of the data by LDA was used for initial assessment of the data streams, and indicated that the data from the microsensor array provided sufficient information to identify, and potentially quantify, each of the target analytes. Further analysis showed that it was possible to separate the methane from the other analytes, as demonstrated after analyzing the data by PLS-DA. Furthermore, the models developed using PLS-DA on one day were able to discriminate the analytes on other days. The success rate was qualitatively dependent on the length of time between the day on which the model was trained and the day on which the validation data were acquired. The work demonstrates the potential of this microsensor array approach to be further developed as a low mass, low-power-consumption screening tool for space exploration.},

The gas sensing properties of differently-prepared metal oxides and loaded metal oxides towards nine environmentally hazardous gases have been individually compared and digested. Promising materials for sensitive and selective detection of each hazardous gas have been identified. For instance, unloaded WO3 nanostructures are the most promising candidates for NO2 sensing while metal catalyst loaded WO3 and gold-loaded SnO2 sensors are among the most effective for NO and N2O sensing, respectively. Moreover, related gas-sensing mechanisms are comprehensively discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this article, the development of an electrochemical methane sensor is presented. The mixed potential based sensor is based on tin doped indium oxide (ITO) and platinum electrodes and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte. The sensor was fabricated using the inexpensive tape-cast method. The sensor responded to methane with a response time of 15s. The staircase response to methane indicated a 44mV sensor response to 100ppm of methane. The sensor response indicated a log-linear relationship with the methane concentration. Upon 500h of sensor testing, a 5\% reduction in methane sensitivity was observed. The cross-sensitivity study on the sensor indicated minimal interference to NO, NO2, and CO2. To improve the sensitivity to methane, a signal conditioning method referred to as the pulsed discharge technique (PDT) was applied. A fourfold increase in methane sensitivity was observed when the sensor was subjected to PDT. Future studies include the miniaturization of the sensor with integrated heater design.},
