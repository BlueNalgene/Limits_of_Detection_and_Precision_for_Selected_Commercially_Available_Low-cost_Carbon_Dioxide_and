@article{airquality_network,
	Abstract = {An objective methodology is presented for determining the number and disposition of ambient air quality stations in a monitoring network for the primary purpose of compliance with air quality standards. The methodolgy utilizes a data base with real or simulated data from an air quality dispersion model for application with a two-step process for ascertaining the optimal monitoring network. In the first step, the air quality patterns in the data base are collapsed into a single composite pattern through a figure-of-merit (FOM) concept. The most desirable locations are ranked and identified using the resultant FOM fields. In the second step the network configuration is determined on the basis of the concept of spheres of influence (SOI) developed from cutoff values of spatial correlation coefficients between potential monitoring sites and adjacent locations. The minimum number of required stations is then determined by deletion of lower-ranked stations whose SOIs overlap. The criteria can be set to provide coverage of less than some fixed, user-provided percentage of the coverage of tha SOIs of the higher ranked stations and for some desired level of minimum detection capability of concentration fluctuations.},

@article{ahlers_rate_2005,
	Abstract = {Thin film metal oxide materials exhibit a bell-shaped variation of the gas sensitivity with sensor operation temperature. With respect to the temperature TM at which a sensitivity maximum occurs, the distribution of the gas sensitivity is asymmetric exhibiting a relatively steep increase below TM and a more moderate drop-off above TM. In this paper a rate equation approach is described, which successfully reproduces temperature- and gas-concentration dependent sensitivity distributions S(T, cgas) experimentally determined for a number of reducing analyte gas molecules. We show that such distributions are determined by two energetic parameters, which are specific for the special adsorbate/adsorbent system involved. These are (i) the strength of adsorption of neutral analyte gas molecules Eads and (ii) the kinetic barrier Ea that needs to be overcome to induce a surface combustion event involving an adsorbed analyte gas molecule and a surface oxygen ion.},

@article{bacsik_ftir_2004,
	Abstract = {Abstract In recent years Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been the dominant technique used for measuring the infrared (IR) absorption and emission spectra of most materials, with substantial advantages in signal?to?noise ratio, resolution, speed, and detection limits. The major advantage of the FTIR technique over other spectroscopic methods is that practically all compounds show characteristic absorption/emission in the IR spectral region and based on this property they can thus be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quest for highly sensitive detection methods for atmospheric trace gas samples, either in laboratory setup or in outdoor remote sensing, has been on agenda for several decades. The fast and intensive development of FTIR spectroscopic techniques has propelled the progress of trace gas analysis of the atmosphere. Since the early 1970s the number and scope of FTIR atmospheric measurements has increased steadily. In this review article we are making an attempt to summarize the results of the most significant contributions to the field of FTIR spectroscopy to trace gas analysis of the atmosphere. Beside the basic description of the extractive and open?path measurement methods, the difficulties connected with collection of appropriate background reference spectra, the ways of qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation of measured spectra, the problems of calibration, and the effects of spectral resolution on detection sensitivity are discussed. The techniques reviewed include in situ IR absorption measurements over open paths in the field, such as remote sensing using the sun, the sky, or natural hot objects as IR sources of radiation, and also IR emission measurements of hot trace gas sources e.g., stack emissions, exhaust gases of combustion sources, and other industrial effluents.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Atmospheric methane concentrations were quantified along transects in Switzerland, using a mobile laser spectrometer combined with a GPS, to identify their spatio-temporal patterns and their controlling factors. Based on these measurements in complex terrain dominated by agriculture, three main factors were found to be responsible for the diurnal and regional patterns of atmospheric methane: (1) magnitude and distribution of methane sources within the region, (2) efficiency of vertical exchange, and (3) local wind patterns within the complex topography. An autocorrelation analysis of measured methane concentrations showed that nighttime measurements close to the ground provide information about regional sources (up to 8.3~km), while daytime measurements only carry information about sources located up to 240~m away in the upwind fetch. Compared to daytime concentrations, nighttime methane concentrations do also better reflect emissions obtained from a spatially explicit methane emission inventory and allowed the investigation of inconsistencies in this emission inventory.},

In this context, a huge number of publications have appeared in the literature which deal with metal oxide gas sensors, in general, and with the prototype material SnO2, in particular. The amount of data published grows continuously and has led to a situation in which even experts in this field tend to lose an overview. The present review describes the reasons for this complexity and outlines unifying concepts to understand the huge amount of published, mostly empirical data. This leads to a comprehension of gas-sensing phenomena in both the application and research domains.},

@article{black_formation_2012,
	Abstract = {Emission factors for PCDD/PCDF determined from open combustion are used to estimate national emission budgets; therefore, it is important to have confidence in their accuracy. It has been suspected that artefacts may form due to the presence of hot metal surfaces of sampling equipment, thus skewing emission factors. In this study, emissions of PCDD/PCDF from open burning of forest biomass over a brick hearth were sampled. Five experiments were carried out using a portable sampler. Experiments were designed where the key variable, sample hood and inlet temperatures were manipulated. Other variables such as fuel origin, type and density were consistent. The measured concentration of PCDD/PCDF in the smoke samples ranged from 0.01 $\mu$g TEQ (t fuel)-1 at the lowest maximum hood temperature (185 $^\circ$C) to 15 $\mu$g TEQ (t fuel)-1 at the highest maximum hood temperature (598 $^\circ$C). when hood inlet temperatures exceeded 400 $^\circ$C emission factors were significantly elevated and this is attributed to the formation of artefacts that can cause the over estimation of emission factors. The increase in hood temperature also resulted in a change in the PCDD/PCDF congener and homologue profile of the emissions. For example at the lowest temperature (Fire 1) the PCDD/PCDF ratio measured was 50:1, whereas at the highest temperature (Fire 5) this ratio was about 0.53:1. When the sampler hood and inlet temperatures were kept in the normal operating range of \&lt;200 $^\circ$C, emission factors were comparable to those observed in many previous studies in Australia with emissions dominated by PCDD.},

	Abstract = {An air quality sensor (AQS) is one of very useful sensors among various sensor devices in automobile. An AQS, located near a fresh air inlet, serves to reduce the amount of pollution entering a vehicle cabin through the HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) system by sending a signal to close the fresh air inlet door/ventilation flap when the vehicle enters a high-pollution area. One chip sensor module, which included a dual gas sensor, humidity sensor and temperature sensor, was developed for an AQS system in automobile. The dual gas sensor combined a reducing gas-sensing element with an oxidizing gas-sensing element on the same substrate to detect toxic oxidizing gases and reducing gases simultaneously. With this sensor module, a peripheral interface controller (PIC) microcontroller was designed with a back propagation neural network to reduce the detection error when the motor vehicles pass through an area with a complicated mixture of gases. The signal from the neural network was modified to give a control signal for the inlet of automobile and to display the outdoor gas environment on the driver's panel or to alert the driver of the dangerous situation.},

	Abstract = {Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after CO2 and contributes to global warming.  Its sources are not uniformly distributed across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and most of the methane flux is expected to stem from hotspots which often occupy a very small fraction of the total landscape area.  Continuous time-series measurements of CH4 concns. can help identify and locate these methane hotspots.  Newer, low-cost trace gas sensors such as the Figaro TGS 2600 can detect CH4 even at ambient concns.  Hence, in this paper we tested this sensor under real-world conditions over Toolik Lake, Alaska, to det. its suitability for preliminary studies before placing more expensive and service-intensive equipment at a given locality.  A reasonably good agreement with parallel measurements made using a Los Gatos Research FMA 100 methane analyzer was found after removal of the strong sensitivities for temp. and relative humidity.  Correcting for this sensitivity increased the abs. accuracy required for in-depth studies, and the reproducibility between two TGS 2600 sensors run in parallel is very good.  We conclude that the relative CH4 concns. derived from such sensors are sufficient for preliminary investigations in the search of potential methane hotspots. [on SciFinder(R)]},

@article{fonollosa_reservoir_2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract Metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors arrays are a predominant technological choice to perform fundamental tasks of chemical detection. Yet, their use has been mainly limited to relatively controlled instrument configurations where the sensor array is placed within a closed measurement chamber. Usually, the experimental protocol is defined beforehand and it includes three stages: the array is first exposed to a gas reference, then to the gas sample, and finally to the reference again to recover the initial state. Such sampling procedure requires signal acquisition during the complete experimental protocol and usually delays the output prediction until the predefined measurement duration is complete. Due to the slow time response of chemical sensors, the completion of the measurement typically requires minutes. In this paper we propose the use of reservoir computing (RC) algorithms to overcome the slow temporal dynamics of chemical sensor arrays, allowing identification and quantification of chemicals of interest continuously and reducing measurement delays. We generated two datasets to test the ability of RC algorithms to provide accurate and continuous prediction to fast varying gas concentrations in real time. Both datasets \textendash{} one generated with synthetic data and the other acquired from actual gas sensors \textendash{} provide time series of MOX sensors exposed to binary gas mixtures where concentration levels change randomly over time. Our results show that our approach improves the time response of the sensory system and provides accurate predictions in real time, making the system specifically suitable for online monitoring applications. Finally, the collected dataset and developed code are made publicly available to the research community for further studies.},

	Abstract = {A new high-precision spectroscopic gas sensor measuring carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) for harsh environmental conditions of automotive applications is presented. The carbon dioxide concentration is the primary parameter for sensing in cabin air quality, as well as an important safety parameter when R744 (carbon dioxide) is used as the refrigerant in the air conditioning system. The automotive environment challenges the potential sensor principles because of the wide temperature range from -40degC to +85degC, the atmospheric pressure from 700 to 1050 mbar, and relative humidity from 0\% to 95\%. The presented sensor system is based on the nondispersive infrared principle with new features for reaching high precision criteria and for enhancing long-term stability. A second IR source is used for internal recalibration of the primary IR source, redundancy purposes, and software plausibility checks. The CO\textsubscript{2} sensor system achieves an accuracy of better than plusmn5.5\% over the whole temperature, pressure, and humidity ranges, with a resolution below 15 ppm and a response time shorter than 5 s. The operating time of the sensor system is more than 6000 h over a corresponding lifetime of more than 15 years.

	Abstract = {An electronic nose based quality predictive model of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) stored at 277 K temperature was proposed in this paper. The changes of sensor array response to samples were caused by the new-generated gas species released by microbial propagations. Principal component analysis method discriminated fresh grass carp samples from medium samples and aged samples. Stochastic resonance signal-to-noise ratio maximums distinguished fresh, medium, and aged grass carp samples successfully. The quality predicting model was developed based on signal-to-noise ratio maximums non-linear fitting regression. Validating experiments demonstrated that the predicting accuracy of this model was 87.5\%. This method presented some advantages including easy operation, quick response, high accuracy, good repeatability, etc. This method is promising in aquatic food products quality evaluating applications.},

	Abstract = {Purpose ? This paper aims to present the methods of improving selectivity and sensitivity of resistance gas sensors. Design/methodology/approach ? This paper compares various methods of improving gas sensing by temperature modulation, UV irradiation or fluctuation-enhanced sensing. The authors analyze low-frequency resistance fluctuations in commercial Taguchi gas sensors and the recently developed tungsten trioxide (WO3) gas-sensing layers, exhibiting a photo-catalytic effect. Findings ? The efficiency of using low-frequency fluctuations to improve gas detection selectivity and sensitivity was confirmed by numerous experimental studies in commercial and prototype gas sensors. Research limitations/implications ? A more advanced measurement setup is required to record noise data but it will reduce the number of gas sensors necessary for identifying the investigated gas mixtures. Practical implications ? Fluctuation-enhanced sensing can reduce the energy consumption of gas detection systems and assures better detection results. Originality/value ? A thorough comparison of various gas sensing methods in resistance gas sensors is presented and supported by exemplary practical applications.},

	Abstract = {We report here on the first record of carbon dioxide gas emission rates from a volcano, captured at $\approx$ 1 Hz. These data were acquired with a novel technique, based on the integration of UV camera observations (to measure SO2 emission rates) and field portable gas analyser readings of plume CO2/SO2 ratios. Our measurements were performedat the North East crater of Mount Etna, southern Italy, and the data reveal strong variability in CO2 emissions over timescales of tens to hundreds of seconds, spanning two orders of magnitude. This carries importantimplications for attempts to constrain global volcanic CO2 release to the atmosphere, and will lead to an increased insight into short term CO2 degassing trends. A common oscillation in CO2 and SO2 emission rates in addition to the CO2/SO2 ratios was observed at periods of $\approx$ 89 s. Our results are furthermore suggestive of an intriguing temporal lag between oscillations in CO2 emissions and seismicity at periods of $\approx$ 300\textendash{}400 s, with peaks and troughs in the former series leading those in the latter by $\approx$ 150 s. This work opens the way to the acquisition of further datasets with this methodology across a range of basaltic systems to better our understandingof deep magmatic processes and of degassing links to manifest geophysical signals.},

However, due to the high power consumption of catalytic gas sensors, which enable reliable gas detection, there is a lack of real WSN deployments aimed at the monitoring of combustible gases. This work reports on the evaluation of a WSN deployed in a real operational boiler facility. The WSN consists of nine battery-powered wireless sensor nodes (with an onboard catalytic sensor) controlled by a network coordinator. In this safety critical environment our objective is twofold: (i) guarantee precise and fast sensor response, and (ii) deliver the sensed data from the sensor nodes to the network coordinator safely in case of methane leakage. We first describe the deployment of the WSN and then evaluate the catalytic sensor response under various conditions. Besides, we evaluate the wireless links using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and link quality indicator (LQI) metrics. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that during 5 months of deployment the sensor nodes have been discharged for 22\textendash{}27\%.},

The sites include Eriophorum tussocks, intertussock depressions, moss-covered areas, and Carex stands. Methane fluxes showed high diel, seasonal, intra site, and between site variability. Eriophorum tussocks and Carex dominated methane release to the atmosphere, with mean annual ($\pm$ 1$\sigma$) net methane fluxes of 8.05 $\pm$ 2.50 g CH4 m-2 and 4.88 $\pm$ 0.73 g CH4 m-2, respectively. Methane fluxes from the moss sites and intertussock depressions were much lower (0.47 $\pm$ 0.16 and 0.62 $\pm$ 0.28 g CH4 m-2 yr-1. Over 90\% of the mean annual methane flux from the Eriophorum, intertussock depressions, and Carex sites occurred between thaw and freeze-up. Some 40\% of the mean annual methane flux from the moss sites occurred during winter. Composite methane fluxes for tussock tundra and Carex-dominated wet meadow tundra environments were produced by weighting measured component fluxes according to areal coverage. Tussock and wet meadow tundra account for an estimated global methane emission of 19\textendash{}33 Tg yr-1.},

	Abstract = {Real-time knowledge of concentration profiles inside the adsorption bed is essential for the feedback control of a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process. A difficulty encountered when developing an observer for this purpose is that the fixed-bed adsorption model is very stiff; thus, either a large number of grid points or an adaptive grid allocation is required to solve the model accurately through discretization. The objective of this study is to present a nonlinear observer with an adaptive grid allocation for an adsorption bed to estimate a spatially distributed state. Experimental verification revealed that the proposed technique can accurately and rapidly predict the breakthrough curve in addition to other process variables despite uncertainties in the model parameters and in the feed composition.},

@article{yang_systematic_2014,
	Abstract = {With ever-rising energy demand and diminishing sources of inexpensive energy resources, energy conservation has become an increasingly important topic. Building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are considered to be a prime target for energy conservation due to their significant contribution to commercial buildings' energy consumption in the US. Knowing a building's occupancy plays a crucial role in implementing demand-response HVAC controls, with a corresponding potential for reduction of HVAC energy consumption, especially in office buildings. This paper evaluates occupancy modeling (both binary detection and multi-class estimation) using twelve ambient sensor variables. Performance of six machine-learning techniques is evaluated in both single-occupancy and multi-occupancy offices. Of the six, the decision-tree technique yielded the best overall accuracy (i.e. 96.0\% to 98.2\%) and root mean square error (RMSE) (i.e. 0.109 to 0.156). The contribution of each individual ambient sensor variable is evaluated via information gain. It is found that CO2, door status, and light variables have important contributions to the final modeling results. It is observed that the overall accuracy generally increases as the number of sensors increases. This paper also examines the possibility of building a global occupancy model, and explores the reasons for low performance of global occupancy estimation. Lastly, the occupancy model is used to estimate and visualize the accumulative room and thermal zone usage in an office test-bed building for three months. The results reveal that the effective vacancy accounts for a substantial portion of the operational hours, varying from 19.8\% to 29.8\% with an average of 23.3\%, which bears significant potential for energy savings. Furthermore, the authors simulated HVAC energy consumption of the test-bed building for three months in DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus, and compared energy consumption of occupancy-based demand-response HVAC controls using the authors' occupancy-modeling results to the conventional HVAC controls currently implemented in the test-bed building. The results demonstrate that 20\% of gas and 18\% of electricity could be effectively saved if occupancy-based demand-response HVAC control is implemented.},

@article{zhu_one_2012,
	Abstract = {A non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) methane gas sensor prototype has achieved a minimum detection limit of 1 parts per million by volume (ppm). The central idea of the design of the sensor is to decrease the detection limit by increasing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the system. In order to decrease the noise level, a single frequency filter algorithm based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adopted for signal processing. Through simulation and experiment, it is found that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the filter narrows with the extension of sampling period and the increase of lamp modulation frequency, and at some optimum sampling period and modulation frequency, the filtered signal maintains a noise to signal ratio of below 1/10,000. The sensor prototype provides the key techniques for a hand-held methane detector that has a low cost and a high resolution. Such a detector may facilitate the detection of leakage of city natural gas pipelines buried underground, the monitoring of landfill gas, the monitoring of air quality and so on.},

A method to detect methane was developed which prevents humidity from affecting the sensor performance and, at the same time, reduces energy consumption. The method, based on step heating the sensor during measurements, enables the power consumption of the sensor to decrease from 35mW typical of the conventional measurement method to 1.2mW. As a result, a wireless sensor node equipped with a planar sensor and powered by three AA batteries could operate for about one year.},

@article{bossche_potential_2017,
	Abstract = {Abstract In order to expand current atmospheric methane monitoring capabilities, we investigated the performance of an off-the-shelf, low-cost, metal oxide based methane (CH4) gas sensor. A sensor assembly was designed that powered the gas sensor and its resistive heater, provided ancillary temperature (T) and relative humidity (rH) measurements, and controlled sensor read-out and data storage. After calibrating the gas sensor with respect to methane concentration ([CH4]), T, and rH, we were able to estimate the [CH4] of lab air over a period of 31days for a large range of T and rH conditions with a systematic error of -1.0ppm and a variable error within $\pm$1.7ppm. The sensor showed no significant drift in [CH4] estimate. We show that sensor accuracy can likely be improved by optimizing the voltage regulator that powers the gas sensor's heater, and by measuring and compensating for the difference in partial oxygen pressure of the air that was sampled during calibration and validation experiments. Such improvements are expected to allow the use of the sensor assembly for fence-line methane monitoring, for example near fossil fuel extraction sites. In its current form, the sensor assembly is suitable for detecting fugitive methane from leak-prone equipment.},

@article{benkstein_analytical_2014,
	Abstract = {Abstract The capabilities of a chemiresistive microsensor array for detecting and identifying trace target analytes were examined under a simulated Martian atmosphere. The simulated environment included low oxygen content (0.15\%) balanced by carbon dioxide, low pressure (7.5hPa) and temperature (199.1K), and trace levels of up to three target molecules presented simultaneously. The target molecules were selected from four possible analytes (methane, hydrogen, ethane and sulfur dioxide), presented to the sensor array at multiple concentrations of 200nmol/mol or less. Signals from four elements of a 16-element microsensor array were employed in the data analyses described. Each element used a different sensing film and was operated with a dynamic temperature program tuned to the background environment. The rich data streams collected from the microsensor array as it was exposed to the complex mixtures and carbon dioxide-based background were analyzed using two approaches: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Analysis of the data by LDA was used for initial assessment of the data streams, and indicated that the data from the microsensor array provided sufficient information to identify, and potentially quantify, each of the target analytes. Further analysis showed that it was possible to separate the methane from the other analytes, as demonstrated after analyzing the data by PLS-DA. Furthermore, the models developed using PLS-DA on one day were able to discriminate the analytes on other days. The success rate was qualitatively dependent on the length of time between the day on which the model was trained and the day on which the validation data were acquired. The work demonstrates the potential of this microsensor array approach to be further developed as a low mass, low-power-consumption screening tool for space exploration.},

Promising materials for sensitive and selective detection of each hazardous gas have been identified. For instance, unloaded WO3 nanostructures are the most promising candidates for NO2 sensing while metal catalyst loaded WO3 and gold-loaded SnO2 sensors are among the most effective for NO and N2O sensing, respectively. Moreover, related gas-sensing mechanisms are comprehensively discussed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, the development of an electrochemical methane sensor is presented. The mixed potential based sensor is based on tin doped indium oxide (ITO) and platinum electrodes and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte. The sensor was fabricated using the inexpensive tape-cast method. The sensor responded to methane with a response time of 15s. The staircase response to methane indicated a 44mV sensor response to 100ppm of methane. The sensor response indicated a log-linear relationship with the methane concentration. Upon 500h of sensor testing, a 5\% reduction in methane sensitivity was observed. The cross-sensitivity study on the sensor indicated minimal interference to NO, NO2, and CO2. To improve the sensitivity to methane, a signal conditioning method referred to as the pulsed discharge technique (PDT) was applied. A fourfold increase in methane sensitivity was observed when the sensor was subjected to PDT. Future studies include the miniaturization of the sensor with integrated heater design.},
